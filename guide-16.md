# API calls

Last Updated: 2025-11-21

Language Supported: English / 简体中文 / 繁體中文 / Português (Brasil) / ไทย

⚠️ Note: This guide only applies to making API calls for Shopee Open API v2.0.

# API domains

  

There are 3 domains available:

-   Production environment

-   [https://openplatform.shopee.cn/](https://openplatform.shopee.cn/) — for developers who deployed their services near Chinese Mainland.
-   [https://openplatform.shopee.com.br/](https://openplatform.shopee.com.br/) — for developer who deployed their services near US.
-   [https://partner.shopeemobile.com/](https://partner.shopeemobile.com/)  — for developer who deployed their services near SG.

-   Sandbox environment

-   [https://openplatform.sandbox.test-stable.shopee.sg/](https://openplatform.sandbox.test-stable.shopee.sg) — for All developers
-   [https://openplatform.sandbox.test-stable.shopee.cn/](https://openplatform.sandbox.test-stable.shopee.cn/) —for Chinese Mainland developers

  

Select the correct domain name, based on the server location you’re accessing the Open API from.

# API request methods

  

Currently, Open API only provides two request methods: GET and POST.

  

# API Protocol

HTTP/JSON for most APIs. HTTP/FORM for some certain APIs, for example, the API for uploading files.

  

# API request parameters

  

In the API document, you will see two types of request parameters:

1.  Common parameter
2.  Request parameter

  

For GET\-type APIs, these two parameters may exist at the same time, or only the common parameter will exist.

  

For POST\-type APIs, these two parameters will exist at the same time.

  

![](https://open.shopee.com/opservice/api/v1/image/download/?image_id=sPZ86F%2FKQhIBn25dCIy5b3nU7xjEI9wxHYIbtVKfV5i2hclNI7gNZVnVE1%2FBfzEmL0ZPkUaVxRni%2BDzi%2FKEfdQ%3D%3D&image_type=png)

  

The table below consists of descriptions for common parameters:

Parameters

Description

partner\_id

All API calls require a partner ID. You can obtain a partner ID by creating an App on the [Shopee Open Platform Console App list page](https://open.shopee.com/myconsole/management/app?from=header). Test partner ID can only be used in the test environment, and Live partner ID can only be used in the production environment.

timestamp

All API calls require [timestamps](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/t/timestam.htm). Example of a timestamp: 1610000000. Each API request needs to be requested within 5 minutes of a timestamp.

sign

All API calls require signatures that are generated using the SHA256 algorithm. Different API types have different signature generation methods. For more details, please refer to the Signature Calculation section in this article.

access\_token

Access tokens are required to obtain and modify seller data-related APIs. Each access token is valid for 4 hours and can be reused within the validity period. The access token needs to be refreshed regularly. Refer to the [Authorization and Authentication](https://open.shopee.com/developer-guide/20) article to learn more about obtaining and refreshing access tokens.

shop\_id

The unique identification ID of a Shopee shop can be obtained after the shop has granted authorization. Refer to the [Authorization and Authentication](https://open.shopee.com/developer-guide/20) article on how to obtain your shop ID.

merchant\_id

The unique identification ID of a Shopee merchant, which can be obtained after a shop has granted authorization. Open API only supports cross-border sellers using a merchant ID. Refer to the [Authorization and Authentication](https://open.shopee.com/developer-guide/20) article on how to acquire your merchant ID.

# Types of Open API

  

In the API document, there are 3 API types due to the different common parameters. The public parameters contained in these 3 types are as follows:

-   Shop API: partner\_id, timestamp, sign, access\_token, shop\_id
-   Merchant API: partner\_id, timestamp, sign, access\_token, merchant\_id
-   Public API: partner\_id, timestamp, sign

  

⚠️ Note: Red items are highlighted to indicate that they are different from Public API.

  

The Public API does not require an access token, while both the Shop and Merchant APIs do.

This means that Shop and Merchant APIs can be called only after the shop has granted authorization.

  

Currently, only Shopee cross-border merchants need to use Merchant API. Local sellers do not need to use it.

# Signature calculation

  

Step 1: Create a base string:

Different types of APIs contain different elements in its base string. Concatenate the API path (without host) and the following common parameters into a single string. You should strictly follow the sequence (base string) as shown below:

  

\*API path example：/api/v2/auth/token/get

  

Shop API: partner\_id, api path, timestamp, access\_token, shop\_id

\*Example：

partner\_id: 2001887

API path: /api/v2/shop/get\_shop\_info

timestamp: 1655714431

access\_token: 59777174636562737266615546704c6d

shop id: 14701711

  

Base string=2001887/api/v2/shop/get\_shop\_info165571443159777174636562737266615546704c6d14701711

  

Merchant API: partner\_id, api path, timestamp, access\_token, merchant\_id

\*Example:

partner\_id: 2001887

API path: /api/v2/global\_product/get\_category

timestamp: 1655714431

access\_token: 09777174636962737266615546704c6d

merchant\_id: 1000000

  

Base string=2001887/api/v2/global\_product/get\_category165571443109777174636962737266615546704c6d1000000

  

Public API: partner\_id, api path, timestamp

\*Example:

partner\_id:2001887

API path: /api/v2/public/get\_shops\_by\_partner

timestamp:1655714431

  

Base string=2001887/api/v2/public/get\_shops\_by\_partner1655714431

  

Step 2: Calculate the signature using the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm

Calculate the signature by using the HMAC-SHA256 hashing algorithm on the base string and partner Key (obtained through the [Shopee Open Platform Console App detail page](https://open.shopee.com/myconsole/management/app?from=header)). The output of the hash function is a hex-encoded string.

  

\*Example：

sign=56f31d01aeda9d08bf456b37f6f6640ef8614b4d6ad49baafe30b39a061f0e26

  

Find out why you may encounter the [“Wrong sign” error](https://open.shopee.com/faq?top=162&sub=166&page=1&faq=188) and how you can resolve the issue.

  

Sample of Code:

Python

```
#!/usr/bin/envpython

# encoding:utf-8

import hmac 

import time

import requests

import hashlib

timest=int(time.time())

host="https://partner.shopeemobile.com 

access_token = "random string"

partner id =80001

partner key = "test....."

#### call shop level api 

shop id =209920

base string ="%s%s%s%s%s"%(partner id, path timest access token, shop id) 

sign = hmac.new( partner key,base string,hashlib.sha256)hexdigest() 

path ="/api/v2/example/shop level/get"

url = host + path + "?partner_id=%s&shop_id=%s&timestamp=%s&access_token=%s&sign=%s"%(partner_id, shop_id, timest, access_token, sign) 

headers={"Content-Type":"application/ison"? 

resp=requests.post(urlheaders=headers)

#### call merchant level api 

merchant id =1234567

base string ="%s%s%s%s%s"%(partner id, path timest, access token, merchant id) 

sign =hmac.new( partner key,base string,hashlib.sha256).hexdigest() 

path ="/api/v2/example/merchant_level/get"

headers =["Content-Type":"application/ison"?

resp =requests.post(url,json=bodyheaders=headers)
```

# API request sample

  

For GET\-type API requests, you need to put both the common parameters and request parameters in the URL.

  

For example: [V2.product.get\_category](https://open.shopee.com/documents/v2/v2.product.get_category?module=89&type=1)

  

API request URL:

https://partner.shopeemobile.com/api/v2/product/get\_category?partner\_id=851249&timestamp=1654673582&shop\_id=1001094&access\_token=367a0a8eb9d1837cbf7c43b587a0faa4&sign=a40fc50a08c382eeee08e2eb00deb8464c6fdcbe4f1c271e033cdbca3ded4d5b&language=zh-hans

  

\*For this API endpoint，partner\_id、timestamp、access\_token、shop\_id and sign are common parameters. Meanwhile, language is a request parameter.

  

  

For POST\-type API requests, you need to insert common parameters in the request URL and request parameters in the request body.

  

For example:[v2.shop.update\_profile](https://open.shopee.com/documents/v2/v2.shop.update_profile?module=92&type=1)

  

API request URL:

https://partner.shopeemobile.com/api/v2/shop/update\_profile?partner\_id=851249&timestamp=1654673582&shop\_id=1001094&access\_token=367a0a8eb9d1837cbf7c43b587a0faa4&sign=80cbce8da907d5a1237711409920fc16908a9f9e01b1254ff9cc44aaf0836122

  

Request body:

{

"shop\_logo": "https://cf.shopee.sg/file/8424390be4677b0b3c37ce6499ce261a",

"description": "TTest",

"shop\_name": "123"

}

  

\*For this API endpoint，partner\_id、timestamp、access\_token、shop\_id、and sign are common parameters. Meanwhile, shop\_logo、description and shop\_name are request parameters.
