# Authorization and Authentication

Last Updated: 2026-07-24

Language Supported: English / 简体中文 / 繁體中文 / Português (Brasil) / ไทย

  

Authorization is an important step to using Open API. You need to be authorized by the seller in order for your App to call non-public APIs required for shop management.

  

You will be authenticated based on the public parameters passed to Open API. If the authentication fails, your call will fail and an error will be returned.

⚠️ Note

-   Authorization Validity

The maximum validity period for each authorization is 365 days. Sellers may customize the authorization expiration time during the authorization process. Once the authorization expires, you will need to contact the seller to re-authorize your App.  

-   SIP Shops Authorization

If a CB SIP primary shop grants authorization to an application, all SIP linked shops will automatically receive the same authorization. However, API access permissions for linked shops are limited. For more details, please refer to the [FAQ](https://open.shopee.com/faq?top=162&sub=166&page=1&faq=214) .

# The authorization process

  

There are 3 steps to complete authorization: generating the authorization link, acquiring authorization from shop(s), and getting and refreshing the access\_token.

  

These will be explained in detail below, along with information on what to prepare before authorization, details of the authorization process, and how to use the information returned after authorization to pass the authentication of the platform.

## Generating the authorization link

  

To improve integration efficiency, the platform provides a new method for generating authorization links. The authorization link is composed of a fixed authorization URL and authorization parameters. All types of Apps can generate authorization links according to the specifications below.

  

Note:

-   For Seller in House System Apps, you can log in to the Open Platform > App list > click “Authorize” > fill in Redirect URL to generate an authorization link.
-   For all other type of App: there is no "Authorize" display, you need to create an authorization link with the following specifications. The authorization link comprises a fixed authorization URL and other required parameters.

  

(Seller in House System Apps)

Other required parameters:

Parameter name

Type

Required

Description

partner\_id

int

Yes

partner\_id obtained from the App.

auth\_type

string

Yes

The role type to be authorized. Enum values:\- seller: used when authorizing a shop or merchant;\- supplier: used when authorizing suppliers (for SCS users);\- user: used when authorizing users (for livestream-related apps, see[https://open.shopee.com/announcements/1190](https://open.shopee.com/announcements/1190) 。

redirect\_uri

string

Yes

The URL where the authorization code (code) is received after the seller completes authorization.  
Production environment: If the production callback URL domain of the app is empty, the redirect\_uri domain is not validated; otherwise, it must match the configured production callback URL domain.  
Sandbox environment: If the sandbox callback URL domain is empty, the redirect\_uri domain is not validated; otherwise, it must match the configured sandbox callback URL domain.

response\_type

string

Yes

The authorization type. Fixed value: "code".

state

string

No                     

A random, unguessable string used to prevent CSRF attacks. It will be returned as-is to the redirect\_uri after authorization is completed.

### Redirect URL Domain Validation Requirements

  

To ensure seller data security, the platform has introduced domain validation for the callback address (redirect\_uri) in authorization links. All developers are required to configure the Test Redirect URL Domain and Live Redirect URL Domain for each App in the Console.

  

The redirect\_uri parameter mentioned above refers to the callback URL configured in the App information page. You can view it as follows:

![](https://open.shopee.com/opservice/api/v1/image/download/?image_id=LWlPMk1MPvBKjXYViUTE2s2D%2BtKyBcgoIp81rFFMYbAcfXxCNla2k9%2FUShW3XzK1YaFBklT1Sj9w%2BlQspVK%2FzA%3D%3D&image_type=png)

  

  

### Notes on Redirect URL Domain Validation

  

1\. For Apps that have already been created but have not yet declared a callback URL domain, developers should log in to the Console and complete the configuration in the App edit page as soon as possible. Before the configuration is completed, the platform will not enforce domain validation, and the existing authorization process will not be affected.

2\. If the domain of the redirect\_uri parameter (or the redirect parameter in legacy links) does not match the Redirect URL Domain configured in the Console when generating an authorization link, the platform will return the following error:

"The domain of redirect\_uri is not consistent with the Redirect URL Domain declared in console"  
(The domain of the callback URL does not match the Redirect URL Domain declared in the Console.)

  

### Authorization Link Examples

  

The following are examples of authorization links for both the Production and Sandbox environments for your reference.

  

Production Environment:

[https://open.shopee.com/auth?partner\_id=10090&auth\_type=seller&redirect\_uri=https://open.shopee.com&response\_type=code](https://open.shopee.com/auth?partner_id=10090&auth_type=seller&redirect_uri=https://open.shopee.com&response_type=code)

  

Sandbox Environment:

https://open.test-stable.shopee.com/auth?partner\_id=1000016&auth\_type=seller&redirect\_uri=https://open.test-stable.shopee.com&response\_type=code

⚠️ NoteThe timestamp used to calculate the sign is only valid for 5 minutes. After the timestamp and the sign expire, the authorization link will no longer be valid, and you need to generate a new link.

## Acquiring authorizations from shop(s)

  

After you share the authorization link with the seller, the seller needs to log in to their account, fill in the verification code sent to their mobile phone, and enter the authorization page.

  

Account types:

-   Shop account: can authorize a single shop;
-   Main account: can authorize multiple merchants / shops;
-   Sub-account: cannot log in to the authorization page.

### Authorizing from a shop account

  

1\. The seller fills in their login details and selects Log In.

![](https://open.shopee.com/opservice/api/v1/image/download/?image_id=KBASnrCAFko2mX9S0T89U%2FSoT4CJMyAjC1M1ZSkJQ1ZNGsMzm0ze%2F7IWwW0sm2fwR4Oe0IYvVEzUYBwXbEwctA%3D%3D&image_type=png)

  

2\. The seller fills in the verification code sent to their mobile phone and selects Verify.

![](https://open.shopee.com/opservice/api/v1/image/download/?image_id=UCU7KvaUzAaB2HKVcZFMWNv%2F%2BQ5uquLHwmjRaybfr8fXkrjrGmyT37Nf4MbtS7bbV2Ac5hCEZLXfPrlPFBAf2Q%3D%3D&image_type=png)

  

3\. Upon logging in, the seller selects Confirm Authorization.

![](https://open.shopee.com/opservice/api/v1/image/download/?image_id=m%2FSS%2FEpwlZ3gfVkoRF1djvREdKCwVR9jmnlr%2F27y6Di2GBlc4SLS6to8TZpplR%2BcgzYukxpFREyhox1zH5ZdvA%3D%3D&image_type=png)

  

4\. The system will display an authorization validity period selector. Sellers can choose from preset durations (7 days, 30 days, 90 days, 180 days, or 365 days), or select “Customize Expiration Time” to set any expiration date within 365 days.

  

5\. After authorization is completed, the frontend page will redirect to the redirect\_uri specified in the authorization link, along with the authorization code (code) and shop ID (shop\_id):

[https://open.shopee.com/?code=xxxxxxxxxx&shop\_id=xxxxxx](https://open.shopee.com/?code=xxxxxxxxxx&shop_id=xxxxxx)

### Authorizing from a main account

  

1\. To log in to a main account, the seller selects Switch to Sub Account on the login page.

![](https://open.shopee.com/opservice/api/v1/image/download/?image_id=LYatUvT%2Fl8dbnhsm%2BMmkTQmzN%2F5EtrHRXU1xvTFwDYiY9j4Nbvs6%2FZas7rxt5tOp57UEYs3r%2BCU2uYIDPd90sA%3D%3D&image_type=png)

  

2\. The seller can then fill in their login details and select Log In.

![](https://open.shopee.com/opservice/api/v1/image/download/?image_id=54kRFFgx%2FwQKfDOSLWx%2FxA%2FS8gkeyp2%2FxZ%2BYlQdiBeaSNwpe%2BhFefIE0jzeh%2Fh1a15BGXOB7v%2BliFgZVKPA5%2BA%3D%3D&image_type=png)

  

3\. The seller selects the shops that need to be authorized.

Note: For cross border sellers, If you need to call the merchant’s API, please remind the seller to select the Auth Merchant checkbox.

![](https://open.shopee.com/opservice/api/v1/image/download/?image_id=clJ%2FGp14b1rbcJubC%2FO9DPSOfrTNvHIdy9PaV%2FdiRYEjg3LGHYATF5k%2BgKl9ljsVyCrHhnnJa69TKjIRDUXKNA%3D%3D&image_type=png)

5\. The seller selects Confirm Authorization to confirm their selection.

![](https://open.shopee.com/opservice/api/v1/image/download/?image_id=M1jgkj8787sKyfBsBvnvHTQ26QPOPmse%2FMAGZSnZNGsFmvCvHYC0HajOw9bEIPJu7pHgo2dyrwFJqhrP1%2BWMXQ%3D%3D&image_type=png)

6\. After authorization is completed, the frontend page will redirect to the redirect\_uri specified in the authorization link, along with the authorization code (code) and main account ID (main\_account\_id):

[https://open.shopee.com/?code=xxxxxx&main\_account\_id=xxxxxx](https://open.shopee.com/?code=xxxxxx&main_account_id=xxxxxx)

## Getting and using the authorization code

  

After the seller completes authorization, the frontend page will redirect to the redirect\_uri specified in the authorization link, along with the authorization code (code) and shop\_id / main\_account\_id. Taking main\_account\_id as an example:

[https://open.shopee.com/?code=xxxxxx&main\_account\_id=xxxxxx](https://open.shopee.com/?code=xxxxxx&main_account_id=xxxxxx)

  

You can use this authorization code (code) to obtain the initial access token (access\_token).

  

Parameters Returned in the Redirect URL

Parameter name

Type

Description

code

string

Returned when the call is successful. This code is used to obtain access\_token and refresh\_token. It is valid for only once and expires after 10 minutes.

shop\_id

int

The ID of the shop that just granted authorization to your App. Returned after authorization was done on a shop account.

main\_account\_id

int

The ID of the main account that just granted authorization to your shop. . Returned after authorization was done on a main account.

  

Note: If the domain of the redirect\_uri parameter (or the redirect parameter in legacy links) does not match the Redirect URL Domain declared in the Console when generating the authorization link, the following error will be returned:

“The domain of redirect\_uri is not consistent with the Redirect URL Domain declared in console”  
(The domain of the callback URL is inconsistent with the Redirect URL Domain declared in the Console.)

## Getting and refreshing the access\_token

  

The access\_token is a dynamic token required for calling non-public APIs. It is valid for 4 hours and can be used multiple times within its validity period.

  

Before the access\_token expires, you need to use the refresh\_token to call the Refresh Access Token API (RefreshAccessToken) to obtain a new access\_token. The refresh\_token is valid for 30 days.

  

⚠️ Note

-   The access\_token and refresh\_token corresponding to each shop\_id / merchant\_id / user\_id / supplier\_id must be stored separately;
-   After a new access\_token is generated, the previous access\_token will remain valid for another 5 minutes;
-   Re-authorization will refresh both the refresh\_token and access\_token;
-   The RefreshAccessToken API must be called within the authorization validity period;
-   If the latest available refresh\_token and access\_token are lost, please refer to the relevant [FAQ](https://open.shopee.com/faq?top=177&sub=180&page=1&faq=216).

### GetAccesstoken

  

After successful authorization, use the code and shop\_id or main\_account\_id in the redirect URL to call this API. This helps you obtain the shop\_id, merchant\_id, access\_token and refresh\_token.

Calculating the sign parameter

  

The sign parameter is not only a component of the authorization link, but also a parameter used for authentication each time it is called. This section will explain how to create a sign base string and calculate the authentication signature through HMAC-SHA256.

  

Creating a sign base string

There are 3 types of APIs that require the use of different parameters to create the sign base string. (consistent with its common parameters).

  

Concatenate the API path (without host) and the common parameters below into a single sign base string in the following order:

  

-   For Shop APIs: partner\_id, api path, timestamp, access\_token, shop\_id
-   For Merchant APIs: partner\_id, api path, timestamp, access\_token, merchant\_id
-   For Public APIs: partner\_id, api path, timestamp

  

Calculating the authentication signature

Use HMAC-SHA256 to hash the sign base string, and use the partner key as the encryption key. The hexadecimal all-lowercase hash value is the authentication signature.

  

Python Code Demo:

Python

```
import hmac
import json
import time
import requests
import hashlib

def shop_auth():
    timest = int(time.time())
    host = "https://partner.shopeemobile.com"
    path = "/api/v2/shop/auth_partner"
    redirect_url = "https://www.baidu.com/"
    partner_id = 80001
    tmp = "test...."
    partner_key = tmp.encode()
    tmp_base_string = "%s%s%s" % (partner_id, path, timest)
    base_string = tmp_base_string.encode()
    sign = hmac.new(partner_key, base_string, hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
    ##generate api
    url = host + path + "?partner_id=%s&timestamp=%s&sign=%s&redirect=%s" % (partner_id, timest, sign, redirect_url)
    print(url)
```

  

Go Code Demo:

Go

```
func auth_shop(){
	timest := strconv.FormatInt(time.Now().Unix(),10)
	host := "https://openplatform.sandbox.test-stable.shopee.sg"
	path := "/api/v2/shop/auth_partner"
	redirectUrl := "https://www.baidu.com/"
	partnerId := strconv.Itoa(2006566)
	partnerKey := "1391fd986fe8ec7569bebed75b0c33ee35eb5a305bed7038657a5cd5f75b1c88"
	baseString := fmt.Sprintf("%s%s%s", partnerId,path,timest)
	h := hmac.New(sha256.New,[]byte(partnerKey))
	h.Write([]byte(baseString))
	sign := hex.EncodeToString(h.Sum(nil))
	url := fmt.Sprintf(host+path+"?partner_id=%s&timestamp=%s&sign=%s&redirect=%s", partnerId,timest,sign, redirectUrl)
	fmt.Println(url)
}
```

  

Java Code Demo:

```
    //generate auth url
    public static void shop_auth(){
        long timest = System.currentTimeMillis() / 1000L;
        String host = "https://partner.shopeemobile.com";
        String path = "/api/v2/shop/auth_partner";
        String redirect_url = "https://www.baidu.com/";
        long partner_id = 123456L;
        String tmp_partner_key = "...";
        String tmp_base_string = String.format("%s%s%s", partner_id, path, timest);
        byte[] partner_key;
        byte[] base_string;
        String sign = "";
        try {
            base_string = tmp_base_string.getBytes("UTF-8");
            partner_key = tmp_partner_key.getBytes("UTF-8");
            Mac mac = Mac.getInstance("HmacSHA256");
            SecretKeySpec secret_key = new SecretKeySpec(partner_key, "HmacSHA256");
            mac.init(secret_key);
            sign = String.format("%064x",new BigInteger(1,mac.doFinal(base_string)));
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        String url = host + path + String.format("?partner_id=%s&timestamp=%s&sign=%s&redirect=%s", partner_id,timest, sign, redirect_url);
        System.out.println(url);
    }
```

### RefreshAccessToken

  

Before the access\_token expires, use the refresh\_token to call this API to obtain a new access\_token and refresh\_token. The new refresh\_token must be used for the next refresh request.

  

Request Information

Path

Details

Production Environment

[https://partner.shopeemobile.com/api/v2/auth/access\_token/get](https://partner.shopeemobile.com/api/v2/auth/access_token/get)

Sandbox Environment

[https://openplatform.sandbox.test-stable.shopee.sg/api/v2/auth/access\_token/get](https://openplatform.sandbox.test-stable.shopee.sg/api/v2/auth/access_token/get)

Request Method

POST

⚠️ Note  
For the same main\_account\_id, the initial access\_token and refresh\_token obtained from GetAccessToken are identical. After calling the RefreshAccessToken API separately for each shop\_id and merchant\_id, each shop\_id and merchant\_id will generate its own independent new access\_token and refresh\_token.  
For example:  
1\. The initial access\_token / refresh\_token obtained from GetAccessToken is assigned to 7 shop\_ids and 3 merchant\_ids.  
2\. After the initial access\_token expires, you use the initial refresh\_token to call RefreshAccessToken,and obtain 10 independent sets of access\_token and refresh\_token for each shop\_id and merchant\_id.  
3\. After this, shop\_id and merchant\_id will no longer share any access\_token or refresh\_token.

  

Public parameters:

  

Consistent with the common parameters of the GetAccessToken API.

By following the steps above, you can call the RefreshAccessToken API  within 4 hours to get new access\_token and refresh\_token. Maintaining the API call loop will ensure you can continue to obtain new sets of access\_token and refresh\_token within the authorization validity period.

⚠️ NoteIf you did not save the new refresh\_token and access\_token returned, [see possible solutions](https://open.shopee.com/faq?top=177&sub=180&page=1&faq=216).

# Canceling authorization

  

You can cancel an authorization by changing the authorization URL or via Seller Center.

### Canceling authorization by changing the authorization URL

  

Authorization can be revoked either by generating a cancellation authorization link or by performing the operation in Seller Center.

  

Revoking authorization via cancellation link  

The method for generating a cancellation authorization link is the same as that for the authorization link, except that the fixed authorization URL should be replaced with the fixed cancellation authorization URL.

Cancellation Process

  

1\. Generate the cancellation authorization link according to the specifications above;

2\. The seller logs in via the cancellation authorization link;

![](https://open.shopee.com/opservice/api/v1/image/download/?image_id=fqiBwLFttdta5Te0%2FnbxzXzFcsupke1%2BNA2OHgx7yb1SY2iwe2LgKaOg0BsWqPAlP3u2RsebI%2F6btGIy3SIXCQ%3D%3D&image_type=png)

3\. The seller clicks “Cancel Authorization” to complete the process. After cancellation, the application will no longer have access to the seller’s information.

![](https://open.shopee.com/opservice/api/v1/image/download/?image_id=o9yQ94Cq36TeoBBlNsV9odZZsWQvw%2FOJYgYXVPSV5PmLUFhnbxkEEZiuLnCXbVCeJ1Cs21BXmBtNdTzaC59LJw%3D%3D&image_type=png)

### Canceling authorization on Seller Center

  

Local Sellers:

1.  The seller logs in to Seller Center and navigates to “Home Page > Platform Partner”;
2.  On the Platform Partner page, the seller can view all apps authorized by the shop / main account, along with their authorization expiration time;
3.  The seller clicks “Separate” in the action column to revoke authorization for the corresponding application.

![](https://open.shopee.com/opservice/api/v1/image/download/?image_id=yz4bkpogbbBi5skg05Tr68D2FH7NDD9bdcXDaKojflAyCSNELVaU0efUGodlnzFL7AVUcOfVJk33%2Bh4N%2FfpY8w%3D%3D&image_type=png)

  

CNSC/KRSC Sellers

“Home Page > Open Platform Management”: Sellers can view which apps have been authorized by the main account. In the authorization management page, sellers can directly revoke the authorization relationship for the merchant or shop.
