# Shopee On-Platform Ads API Guide

Last Updated: 2026-01-29

Language Supported: English / 简体中文 / 繁體中文 / ไทย

# What is Shopee Ads

Shopee Ads allow you to create ads within Shopee’s platform to increase exposure for your products and shop.

  

Learn Shopee Ads：[https://ads.shopee.sg/learn/faq/96/195](https://ads.shopee.sg/learn/faq/96/195)

# Ads Open API Usage Rules

  

When using the advertising  API, you need to abide by the following rules we have listed so that Shopee can create a fair and safe market for all sellers:

1.  When processing advertising data, you need to comply with the platform's [data protection policy](https://open.shopee.com/developer-guide/32).
2.  The advertising API is limited to Shopee's official cooperative ISVs and is used with platform sellers. It can be used for shop advertising operations and official cooperation agency operation projects. The advertising API cannot be used for other purposes.
3.  shop data may not be used for any purpose other than shop operations and official Shopee cooperation projects.
4.  To retrieve seller shop data through the ISV API, you need to obtain the consent of the platform seller through the authorization process.

  

Tips: If you fail to comply with our norms and rules, you will receive a warning email from Shopee; if you fail to modify it in time, you may face our penalties.

## 5\. GMV Max Ads Overview

  

GMV Max Ads are Shopee’s full-funnel advertising solutions that leverage automated bidding and intelligent traffic allocation to maximize sellers’ GMV performance.

  

Currently, Shopee supports two types of GMV Max Ads:

-   Shop GMV Max Ads (Shop-level / Auto-selected Products)

  

Both ad types are powered by system automation and optimized around ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) targets.

## 6\. Item GMV Max Ads (Item-level Full-site Promotion)

  

Item GMV Max Ads are item-level full-site promotion ads designed to promote specified products across Shopee’s entire traffic inventory.

  

Key Characteristics:

-   Created at the item level
-   Uses Auto Bidding
-   Optimized around ROAS targets
-   Suitable for sellers aiming to scale GMV for individual products

  

To create Item GMV Max Ads via Open API, use:

-   v2.ads.create\_manual\_product\_ads
-   Key Parameter:

-   bidding\_method = auto → Item GMV Max Ads

![](https://open.shopee.com/opservice/api/v1/image/download/?image_id=6ndPDeh76t4V7oQyCwXKiJWLfmQRbu5uEgfqrvP1wzIT0Wz5FdO8%2B0lBR1Q7er%2FhHT5Hw2Y3I28RgCpmQ2MtTQ%3D%3D&image_type=png)

  

Before creating Item GMV Max Ads, developers may retrieve recommended ROAS using:

v2.ads.get\_product\_recommended\_roi\_target

![](https://open.shopee.com/opservice/api/v1/image/download/?image_id=OGq9NqGIXTY47D%2BDFfdtgC2k%2BEpgRNjCvjEGD1RumN%2B8%2BPor5f045DTWRbuzw89g9ziq4r27818uH5cNz4LwHQ%3D%3D&image_type=png)

  

Developers may also retrieve recommended budget ranges via:

v2.ads.get\_create\_product\_ad\_budget\_suggestion

![](https://open.shopee.com/opservice/api/v1/image/download/?image_id=H%2B0UMdIyPMMqGRzwnBotqObwvQPZ1gAT4udE2%2B9gLiT%2FsgtPhO8o%2F8wQdRKdm%2Bm7bK2g5Qna8VZ7icD2l1GGJQ%3D%3D&image_type=png)

  

Typical Flow:

1\. Call v2.ads.get\_product\_recommended\_roi\_target to retrieve recommended ROAS

2\. Call v2.ads.get\_create\_product\_ad\_budget\_suggestion to retrieve budget suggestions

3\. Call v2.ads.create\_manual\_product\_ads (bidding\_method = auto)

  

Note:

ROAS and budget recommendations are system-generated references. Final performance depends on actual delivery and system learning.

  

## 7\. Shop GMV Max Ads

Shop GMV Max Ads are shop-level full-site promotion ads. The system automatically selects products within the shop and optimizes delivery based on budget and ROAS settings to maximize overall shop GMV.

  

Key Characteristics:

-   Created at the shop level
-   System automatically selects products and dynamically allocates budget
-   Supports Auto Bidding and Custom ROAS
-   Suitable for sellers seeking lower management overhead and scalable shop GMV growth

  

Bidding Modes:

1.  Auto Bidding: The system explores traffic opportunities automatically within acceptable ROAS ranges to scale exposure and GMV.
2.  Custom ROAS: The system optimizes delivery based on advertiser-defined ROAS targets to balance GMV and efficiency.

  

To create Shop GMV Max Ads via Open API, use:

-   v2.ads.create\_gms\_product\_campaign
-   Key Field: roas\_target

-   Not provided or = 0 → Auto Bidding (Shop GMV Max)
-   \> 0 → Custom ROAS (Shop GMV Max)

![](https://open.shopee.com/opservice/api/v1/image/download/?image_id=w5KtlLTaUS4X0eHvUDUQeIYQmjRpT0e4BUad8v2JznMPF3cWiujlEJvrZYKtUgeXdEtI69QVxwLh%2BF0C1xbvnw%3D%3D&image_type=png)

  

Before creation, developers may validate eligibility using:

Management & Performance APIs:

-   Campaign Configuration & Management

-   v2.ads.edit\_gms\_product\_campaign: Update Shop GMV Max campaign configuration (e.g. bidding mode, ROAS settings).

-   v2.ads.get\_gms\_item\_performance: Retrieve item-level performance metrics within a Shop GMV Max campaign.

  

Typical Integration Flow

  

1.  Call v2.ads.check\_create\_gms\_product\_campaign\_eligibility

-   Validate whether the shop is eligible to create a Shop GMV Max campaign.

3.  Call v2.ads.create\_gms\_product\_campaign

-   Create a Shop GMV Max campaign.

5.  (Optional) Call v2.ads.edit\_gms\_product\_campaign

-   Update or adjust campaign configuration after creation.

7.  Call v2.ads.get\_gms\_campaign\_performance and v2.ads.get\_gms\_item\_performance

-   Monitor campaign-level and item-level performance on an ongoing basis.

  

Note:

-   Products are auto-selected by default and updated daily. If sellers manually adjust the product list, the seller-configured list takes precedence.
-   Performance improves during the learning phase. Avoid frequent configuration changes during this period.

  

## 8\. Manual Product Ads

Key Characteristics:

-   Created at the item level
-   Uses Manual Bidding
-   Supports keyword and item targeting
-   Suitable for sellers requiring granular control

  

To create Manual Product Ads, use:

-   v2.ads.create\_manual\_product\_ads
-   Key Parameter:

![](https://open.shopee.com/opservice/api/v1/image/download/?image_id=d294xey%2FYasFp0vjhNXYQVJsHmPfJv%2BneVEmMvCUbbyCTOYGwGG2e8l7YKab1JvElmLMw1W1qzdrl1JQgBx%2FpA%3D%3D&image_type=png)

For Manual Product Ads (bidding\_method = manual), developers may use

[v2.ads.get\_recommended\_item\_list](https://open.shopee.cn/documents/v2/v2.ads.get_recommended_item_list?module=167&type=1) and [v2.ads.get\_recommended\_keyword\_list](https://open.shopee.cn/documents/v2/v2.ads.get_recommended_keyword_list?module=167&type=1)

to obtain recommended items and keywords, and then configure budget, placements,

and other campaign settings to start ad delivery.
